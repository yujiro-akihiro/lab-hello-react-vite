<!-- index.html is the only .html file for the entire React app. 
For this reason, we say that React is a Single-Page Application.
Instead of having many HTML pages, the entire app content is 
managed and updated dynamically by JavaScript. 
The app and all its content are displayed on one HTML page. -->
